# Introduction
A basic prototype for a BGE networking addon.

This addon implements a user-friendly (ish) logic brick interface to the PyAuthServer network libraries.
The UI exposes RPC calls, Attribute replication, network class composition, network states and Signals to the SCA logic layer.

Currently, only the 2_team_selection demo is functional
